üìù To-Do List Application

A simple, client-side To-Do List application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks, with all data persisted locally using the browser's Local Storage.

‚ú® Features

‚Ä¢	Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks via the input field.

‚Ä¢	Remove Tasks: Permanently delete tasks from the list.

‚Ä¢	Edit Tasks: Modify existing task descriptions directly.

‚Ä¢	Persistence: Tasks are saved in the browser's Local Storage and remain available even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

‚Ä¢	Responsive Design: Styled using CSS for a clean, user-friendly interface.

The primary goal of this application was to practice and solidify skills in pure JavaScript, particularly event delegation and effective Local Storage management. The result is a fully functional, browser-persistent utility that serves as a solid foundation for more complex web projects.
